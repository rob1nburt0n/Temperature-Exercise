# Temperature-Exercise
...........YOUR MISSION...........
  Write a program that will convert a temperature from
  fahrenheit to celsius, or from celsius to fahrenheit.
  In the HTML, have one input field where someone can enter
  in a temperature. Then have a radio button group where
  Celsius or Fahrenheit can be selected as the scale that the
  number should be converted to. Then a button that,
  when clicked, displays the converted.
